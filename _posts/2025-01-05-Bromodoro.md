#### What is the Pomodoro Technique? 🕒  

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that breaks work into intervals (traditionally 25 minutes) separated by short breaks. This helps maintain focus, prevent burnout, and make learning or work sessions more productive.  

Bromodoro is my humble attempt to make this technique even more effective by adding features like task management and automatic progress tracking.
