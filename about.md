I am an AI Engineer and I believe we can change the world using AI. The future is now. We have the resources and tools today to rebuild a sustainable planet that works for all of us. I am excited about amazing discoveries and unexpected results made by the intelligence created by humans. I’m curious about the new knowledge we’ve gained and the potential it represents. AI will be an incredible part of human transformation. It will also be a powerful weapon in the hands of dictators and criminals to steal, pervert, and control human society. So, we should experiment but we need to be careful. Amazing people are building a beautiful and safer future with AI. I really want to be a part of that process, learning, transformation, hence here I am.
