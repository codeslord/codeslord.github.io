Hi! I am an AI and Robotics engineer with a passion for using technology to make the world a better place. I believe that Robotics and artificial intelligence has the power to solve some of the most pressing problems facing humanity, from climate change and environmental degradation to healthcare and education. The future is now. We have the resources and tools today to rebuild a sustainable planet that works for all of us. I am excited about amazing discoveries and unexpected results made by the intelligence created by humans. I’m curious about the new knowledge we’ve gained and the potential it represents. AI will be an incredible part of human transformation.

I have a strong background in computer science, artificial intelligence and Robotics, with experience in both industry and academia. I have worked on a wide range of projects, from developing deep reinforcement learning algorithms to creating computer vision and natural language models.

In my free time, I enjoy staying up-to-date on the latest developments in the field of Robotics and AI and exploring new ways to apply this technology to real-world problems. I am also an avid supporter of responsible AI, and believe that it is important to consider the ethical implications of our work as we strive to build a better future.

I am excited to share my knowledge and experiences with others on this blog, and hope to inspire others to join me in using AI to make a positive impact on the world.
